This Expert Advisor (EA) is designed to manage risk by incorporating automatic stop loss and preventing trades from exceeding a specified leverage limit in MetaTrader5. The EA calculates lot size based on a defined risk percentage per trade and automatically places stop loss orders at a fixed distance from the entry price.
